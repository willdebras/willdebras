### Hi there 👋

My name is Will Bonnell and I work at in the Department of Statistics and Data Science NORC at the University of Chicago as a data analyst, mainly building R Shiny applications and D3 visualizations. I also help organize a group/set of events called the [R Community Collaboratives](https://chircollab.github.io/). I have about three to four years of experience in R and SQL and about two years of experience programming production dashboards in R Shiny, with skills in D3.js, CSS, and vanilla JS. 


- 🔭 I’m currently learning React, building scrollytelling products in GSAP at NORC, and expanding my knowldge of UI/UX design.
- 🌱 I’m also getting better at Julia, expanding my knowledge of Bayesian methods and causal inference, and thinking about PhD programs in international relations.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interactive data visualisations and data journalism. I'm available for commission or collaboration. Some of my past vizes are available on [my website](https://willdebras.github.io/viz/).
- 💬 Ask me about some of [my research](https://willdebras.github.io/cv/) on spatial influences on voting, how the hell the {openxlsx} package works, or why I think moral foundations theory is garbage.
