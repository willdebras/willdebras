### Hi there 👋

My name is Will Bonnell and I work at NORC at the University of Chicago doing political survey research. I also help organize a group/set of events called the [R Community Collaboratives](https://chircollab.github.io/). I have three years of experience in R and SQL and about a year or two experience programming production dashboards in R Shiny, with some skills in CSS/JS. 


- 🔭 I’m currently working on a [piece of a scrollytelling](https://willdebras.shinyapps.io/migration_2018/) built in R shiny displaying migration data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Julia, expanding my knowledge of Bayesian methods and causal inference, and applying to PhD programs in international relations.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interactive data visualisations and data journalism. I'm available for commission or collaboration. Some of my past vizes are available on [my website](https://willdebras.github.io/viz/).
- 💬 Ask me about some of [my research](https://willdebras.github.io/cv/) on spatial influences on voting, how the hell the {openxlsx} package works, or why I think moral foundations theory is garbage.
- 📫 How to reach me: [twitter](https://twitter.com/_willdebras)!

- 📈 stayta - a 'proof-of-concept' app to parse simple stata commands into R and return R output
